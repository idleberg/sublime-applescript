v2.0.0
======

As of this version, you can directly edit binary script files (.scpt) in
Sublime Text. Since this requires osacompile/osadecompile, this feature is only
available on macOS.

Please help to improve this package and post issues on the GitHub repository:

Huge thanks to Tyrone Trevorrow, whose BinaryPlist package is the foundation
for this package!
