## Instructions

### Completions

Many commands can simply be triggered by completing a standard AppleScript command. Commands such as `try`, `if`, `repeat`, or `set` will create a code block. Use the `Tab` key to jump between inputs.

### Snippets

There are several snippets included to generate license-texts enclosed in a comment. To trigger these, try the `comment` command with license names as parameter. You could, for example, use `comment:mit` to add an *MIT License* text, or `comment:gpl2` for the *GNU General Public License* in version 2.0. Use the `Tab` key to jump between inputs.
