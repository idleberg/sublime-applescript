## Usage

### Completions

Many commands can simply be triggered by completing a standard AppleScript command. Commands such as `try`, `if`, `repeat`, or `set` will create a code block. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump between input-fields.

### Snippets

There are several snippets included to generate license-texts enclosed in a comment. To trigger these, try the `license` command with license names as parameter. You could, for example, use `license:mit` to add an *MIT License* text, or `license:gpl2` for the *GNU General Public License* in version 2.0. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump between input-fields.

You can directly address several macOS applications to have them perform some action. For instance you can scaffold a script using `Mail:Send message`, telling Mail to send a message. You can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump between recipient, subject and message fields. Other examples would be `System Preferences:Security` to open the according panel in System Preferences, or `iTunes:Open file` to play a piece of music in iTunes.

More examples:

* `Calendar:Add event`
* `Finder:Open location`
* `OS:Notification Message`
* `Safari:Open location`
* `Terminal:Run shell script`

### Build System

Build systems are available on macOS to compile or run scripts. Use the default shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to build or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to select a build system variant.

**Note:** When editing binary AppleScripts decompiled by this package, you can simply save the file for it to be re-compiled. Building it will lead to undesired results.
